# LeSuperInventaire-Website
 
 "Le Super Inventaire" is a project I realized to code my first website. In order to create it I used PHP, MySQL, CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript. For the server I used Xampp with Appache and MySQL.

The goal of the website is to manage your inventory. You can add an order from your clients and manage them. You can add and manage your products by changing the name of the product, the picture of the product, the quantity you have, the rate or if it's availaible. You can also create brands and categories for your product and manage them as well. Here's a demonstration: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109554149/183259520-d5b2e2b8-58f1-4916-b1e4-d2a7549ac65f.mp4


For the pictures on the sides and for some of the products I used photoshop, and thanks to that I put myself in the project. 

Will you be able to find me ?
